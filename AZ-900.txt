sandbox  which allows you to practice creating cloud resources for free at your own pace.

-With the shared responsibility model, these responsibilities get shared between the cloud provider and the consumer.
 Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider.
 The consumer isn’t collocated with the datacenter,
 so it wouldn’t make sense for the consumer to have any of those responsibilities.
 
 ***You’ll always be responsible for:

The information and data stored in the cloud
Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization
The cloud provider is always responsible for:

The physical datacenter
The physical network
The physical hosts
Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

Operating systems
Network controls
Applications
Identity and infrastructure
--------------------
When building or deploying a cloud application,
 two of the biggest considerations are uptime (or availability) and the ability to handle demand (or scale).
 -----
Scaling generally comes in two varieties: vertical and horizontal. 
Vertical scaling is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources.
 Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources.
--------------
Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. 
It's also one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.

You can design your applications to automatically take advantage of this increased reliability. 
In some cases, your cloud environment itself will automatically shift to a different region for you, with no action needed on your part. 
You’ll learn more about how Azure leverages global scale to provide reliability later in this series.

------------
There are two types of manageability for cloud computing ::
1) Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources.eg. Deploy, Monitor, Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics,
 so you’re aware of performance in real time.
2) Management in the cloud speaks to how you’re able to manage your cloud environment and resources.
Through a web portal.
Using a command line interface.
Using APIs.
Using PowerShell.
------------
The physical infrastructure for Azure starts with datacenters. Conceptually, the datacenters are the same as large corporate datacenters.
 They’re facilities with resources arranged in racks, with dedicated power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.
--
A region is a geographical area on the planet that contains at least one, 
but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. 
Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced.
--
Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. 
Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. 
An availability zone is set up to be an isolation boundary. 
If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.
---

To ensure resiliency, a minimum of three separate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions. 
However, not all Azure Regions currently support availability zones.
--
Not all Azure services automatically replicate data or automatically fall back from a failed region to cross-replicate to another enabled region. 
In these scenarios, recovery and replication must be configured by the customer.
---
In addition to regular regions, Azure also has sovereign regions. 
Sovereign regions are instances of Azure that are isolated from the main instance of Azure. 
You may need to use a sovereign region for compliance or legal purposes.
--
The management infrastructure includes Azure resources and resource groups, subscriptions, and accounts.

--
Resource groups are simply groupings of resources
--
 resource groups can't be nested, meaning you can’t put resource group B inside of resource group A.
--
When you apply an action to a resource group, that action will apply to all the resources within the resource group.
--
10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory.
A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.
Each management group and subscription can support only one parent.
--
An Azure VM gives you the flexibility of virtualization without having to buy and maintain the physical hardware that runs the VM. 
However, as an IaaS offering, you still need to configure, update, and maintain the software that runs on the VM.
--
Virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs.

there’s no additional cost for configuring an availability set. You only pay for the VM instances you create.
--
Use a route-based VPN gateway if you need any of the following types of connectivity:

Connections between virtual networks
Point-to-site connections
Multisite connections
Coexistence with an Azure ExpressRoute gateway
------

Azure DNS is based on Azure Resource Manager, which provides features such as:

-Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) to control who has access to specific actions for your organization.
-Activity logs to monitor how a user in your organization modified a resource or to find an error when troubleshooting.
-Resource locking to lock a subscription, resource group, or resource. 
Locking prevents other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources.
-----------
Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs.
 The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease
-----------
Locally redundant storage (LRS) replicates your data three times within a single data center in the primary region. 
LRS provides at least 11 nines of durability (99.999999999%) of objects over a given year.
-LRS is the lowest-cost redundancy option and offers the least durability compared to other options.
-LRS protects your data against server rack and drive failures. However, if a disaster such as fire or flooding occurs within the data center, 
all replicas of a storage account using LRS may be lost or unrecoverable
--------------
For Availability Zone-enabled Regions, zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates your Azure Storage data synchronously 
across three Azure availability zones in the primary region. 
ZRS offers durability for Azure Storage data objects of at least 12 nines (99.9999999999%) over a given year.
-With ZRS, your data is still accessible for both read and write operations even if a zone becomes unavailable.
-Microsoft recommends using ZRS in the primary region for scenarios that require high availability.
-By default, data in the secondary region isn't available for read or write access unless there's a failover to the secondary region.
-------
Azure Storage typically has an RPO(recovery point objective) of less than 15 minutes, 
although there's currently no SLA on how long it takes to replicate data to the secondary region.
--------------
GRS copies your data synchronously three times within a single physical location in the primary region using LRS. 
It then copies your data asynchronously to a single physical location in the secondary region (the region pair) using LRS. 
GRS offers durability for Azure Storage data objects of at least 16 nines (99.99999999999999%) over a given year.
-Microsoft recommends using GZRS for applications 
requiring maximum consistency, durability, and availability, excellent performance, and resilience for disaster recovery.
- if you enable read access to the secondary region, your data is always available, even when the primary region is running optimally. 
For read access to the secondary region, enable read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS) or read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS).
-Remember that the data in your secondary region may not be up-to-date due to RPO.
-------------
With SSO, you need to remember only one ID and one password. Access across applications is granted to a single identity that's tied to the user, 
which simplifies the security model
--
if you hire a new engineer and add them to the Azure RBAC group for engineers, 
they automatically get the same access as the other engineers in the same Azure RBAC group.
-
if you add additional resources and point Azure RBAC at them, 
everyone in that Azure RBAC group will now have those permissions on the new resources as well as the existing resources.
-The objective of defense-in-depth is to protect information and prevent it from being stolen by those who aren't authorized to access it.
------
esource tags are another way to organize resources. Tags provide extra information, or metadata, about your resources.
------
Azure Policy evaluates your resources and highlights resources that aren't compliant with the policies you've created. 
Azure Policy can also prevent noncompliant resources from being created.
-if you set a policy at a high level, it will automatically be applied to all of the groupings that fall within the parent.
----
Azure Advisor evaluates your Azure resources and makes recommendations to help improve reliability, security, 
and performance, achieve operational excellence, and reduce costs.
